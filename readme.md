'Nuff Tabs
==========

Google Chrome extension that allows you to limit the number of open tabs.

Specify the maximum number in the options. When you surpass the limit, an open tab is closed automatically. Select the rule that decides which tab to close:
- Oldest: close the oldest tab
- Newest: close the newest tab (avoids auto-closing tabs)
- Least Recently Used: close the tab that was least recently active
- Least Frequently Used: close the tab that was active the least time
- Random: close a random tab (caution - only for daredevils)
